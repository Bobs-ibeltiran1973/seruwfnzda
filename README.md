wow, okay, so i just finished watching revelations and man, what a trip! i swear, this movie’s got me all sorts of ways right now. like, one minute i'm totally captivated and the next i'm just scratching my head. you know what i mean? 😅 it’s like they threw everything at us and just said, “deal with it” lol. i had to download the movie cause everyone was talking, and no spoilers were gonna ruin this for me. 

anyway, dude, the visuals though! seriously, what was that all about? it was like the director decided to just go bananas and cranked everything up to 11. i'm not even mad, but my eyes might need a massage after that rollercoaster. maybe i’m biased cause i’m a massage therapist, but tension levels were high, haha! 

> did you see those plot twists coming? i didn’t. felt a bit like a wild dream that you just barely remember when you wake up... kinda foggy but intense. also, some scenes were straight-up bonkers, like, did that just happen or am i tripping? gonna have to watch the movie again just to wrap my head around it, no joke.

and can we talk about the soundtrack? it was like boom, bam, clash—totally nuts! switching from peaceful zen vibes to full-on chaos. kept thinking a massage playlist would chill out that soundtrack tension, lol. almost felt therapeutic in a weird way.

string randomThought = why did i type this?;

but yeah, overall, i’ve got more questions than answers now. are we ever gonna get real closure with these endings? or is this just the way it’s gonna be now? ah, i’m too tired to dig deeper. need some zen time, maybe i’ll throw on a sitcom or something. what did you think? am i the only one tripping here?
